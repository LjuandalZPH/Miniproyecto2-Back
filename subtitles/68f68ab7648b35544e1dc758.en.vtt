00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
A lone starship drifts through the void.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.000
Engines hum softly; systems check green.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Starlight paints silver lines across the hull.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Navigator: "Course set to the outer belt."

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Captain: "Hold steady. Watch for debris."

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
A faint ping—an unknown signal appears.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Autopilot disengaged; manual control assumed.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Gravity ripples bend the starfield ahead.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
"It looks like a wake—something just jumped."

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Shields rise; the ship edges toward the source.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The beacon flashes: coordinates, then silence.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
"Mark the signal. The journey continues."
