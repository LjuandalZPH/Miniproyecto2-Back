00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
A rabbit rests on a red cushion.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.600
Soft breaths rise and fall.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.500
Whiskers twitch at a distant sound.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.300
Ears flick; the room stays calm.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.300
Fur catches the light—warm and plush.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.200
The cushion’s red fabric looks velvety.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.200
A slow blink; paws stretch slightly.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.000
Peaceful and still, the moment lingers.
