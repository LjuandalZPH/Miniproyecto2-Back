[Ambient music]

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Welcome to this short documentary about jellyfish.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Jellyfish live in oceans around the world and come in remarkable shapes.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
This species glows softly in the dark thanks to bioluminescence.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Watch their tentacles drift with the current, as if they were dancing.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
They are very ancient animals, even older than dinosaurs.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Though they seem delicate, they have survived millions of years of change.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Some jellyfish can be venomous; admire them, but do not touch.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Their bodies are made mostly of water, like a living bubble.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Bioluminescence helps attract prey and confuse potential predators.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
In this habitat, the light shifts constantly and creates unique scenery.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Thank you for joining us in this brief dive into the marine world.
