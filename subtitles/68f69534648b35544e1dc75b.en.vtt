00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
A cybernetic hologram flickers to life.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.000
The world appears—wireframe and luminous.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.500
Data streams arc across continents.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.000
The globe rotates with a soft hum.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.500
Scan lines sweep from pole to pole.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.000
Pins of light mark cities and networks.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.500
Rotation speeds up; details sharpen.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.000
