00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
A field of red flowers in the breeze.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Petals sway like waves across the land.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Sunlight warms the stems and leaves.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Bees weave through crimson blossoms.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Colors deepen; the wind softens.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
A quiet momentâ€”simple and bright.
