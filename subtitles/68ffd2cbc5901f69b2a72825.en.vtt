00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
A girl steps into frame; music kicks in.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
She finds the beat—hips sway, arms loose.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
A parked car glows softly in the background.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Footwork quickens; crisp pops and turns.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
She slides forward, then back—confidence rising.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Head roll, shoulder hit; rhythm stays tight.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Camera pans slightly; the car stays in frame.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Spin to a low pose; hands trace the beat.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
She steps aside, accenting snares and claps.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Final pose—smile held, music fades.
