00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.300
A person stares at a laptop screen.

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.600
Charts dip—red candles across the graph.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.800
They exhale; shoulders sink.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.100
Hands rub the temples—frustration.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.500
A quick glance at the balance—grim.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.000
They close the lid halfway; a deep breath.
