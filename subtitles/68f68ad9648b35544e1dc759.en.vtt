00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
Wind whispers through an empty street.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.000
A man steps into frame—everything looks gray.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Footsteps echo, slow and steady.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
He focuses on a parked car ahead.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
[Keys clink] His pace quickens.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The car’s surface reflects the overcast sky.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
He reaches for the handle—hesitates.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
A breath. Then the door clicks open.
